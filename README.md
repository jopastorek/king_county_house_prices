## Data Cleaning 


## Feature engineering
Since location of the property is a major driver for price, new features such as the distance in km to Seattle are reasonable to add. Also, features based on the zipcode the property belongs to are highly informative since traits of whole neighborhoods can be aggregated in this way.

## Model Selection
For prediction linear regression is selected as the model.
